# ***Time-Series Analysis of Gold Prices, USD Exchange Rates, and Macroeconomic Indicators in Nepal (2018–2025)***



***Project Description***

This project conducts a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Nepal’s gold market in relation to USD exchange rates and key macroeconomic indicators between 2018 and 2025.

Using daily gold price and USD foreign exchange records, combined with annual national-level economic data (inflation rate, per capita income, interest rate), the analysis seeks to:

* Uncover temporal trends and interdependencies among gold prices, currency movement, and economic metrics.
* Quantitatively assess the correlations between gold valuation and macroeconomic factors.
* Visualize annual trends and relationships using advanced data visualization techniques.



&nbsp;	The outcomes enable financial analysts, economists, and policy planners to understand better how global and domestic factors have influenced Nepal’s gold market over recent years. Recommendations are provided for evidence-based investment strategies and future research directions, including the significance of currency fluctuations and inflationary trends in shaping the dynamics of gold prices.



All computational steps are fully reproducible in Jupyter Notebook, with outputs and datasets stored in a well-documented repository structure.

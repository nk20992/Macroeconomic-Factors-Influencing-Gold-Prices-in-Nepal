**Analysis Summary**

- Gold price and USD exchange rates (buy/sell) are highly correlated each year, suggesting a direct relationship between currency values and gold valuation in Nepal.
- Inflation rate shows a moderately negative correlation with gold price, indicating that years of higher inflation do not always correspond to higher gold prices in this dataset.
- All data values (inflation etc.) are positive; negative correlation means trends move oppositely on average.
- These results highlight that currency dynamics are a key driver of gold price, while inflation effects may be more complex over annual periods.

_Recommendation:_ For deeper analysis, explore monthly or seasonal trends and consider additional macroeconomic variables.

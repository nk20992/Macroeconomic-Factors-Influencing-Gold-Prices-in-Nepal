# Macroeconomic-Factors-Influencing-Gold-Prices-in-Nepal
This project constitutes a thorough and methodologically rigorous analysis of the interplay between gold prices, USD exchange rates, and core macroeconomic indicators for Nepal over the pivotal period from 2018 to 2025. By synthesizing high-frequency daily datasets on gold prices and foreign currency rates with annual records detailing inflation rates, interest rates, and per capita income, it delivers an integrated and multifaceted perspective on the factors driving the value of gold in a developing market economy. Employing Python and Jupyter Notebooks as its analytical backbone, the project performs precise data aggregation—transforming daily records into meaningful yearly averages—ensures comprehensive data cleaning and merging, and applies robust statistical methods to identify and interpret patterns and associations that are critical for both investment and policy decisions. Through visually compelling dual-axis trend plots, scatterplots, and correlation tables, this analysis reveals a strong empirical relationship between movements in the US dollar and gold price, underscoring the influence of currency fluctuation on asset valuation, while uncovering more subtle, sometimes negative, correlations with inflation rates—findings which prompt a deeper investigation into local economic dynamics and regulatory impacts on asset prices. Beyond visualization, the study interprets results for practical use by financial analysts, policymakers, and researchers, offering insights into risk management and portfolio optimization, and recommending the use of monthly or seasonal breakdowns for further research. Every step is fully documented, from loading .csv files and structuring project directories to saving automated output plots for publication, ensuring the analysis is reproducible, extensible, and ready for peer review or real-world deployment. Whether serving as a template for financial exploration in other regions or as a cornerstone for economic decision-making in Nepal, this project stands as a testament to the value of data science in unraveling the complex linkages between markets and macroeconomic forces.
